=========
This example won't run directly in JBossAS directly. Because Springframework 2.5.x does not support JBoss VFS properly. To deploy this example under
JBossAS, you should use JBoss Snowdrop(http://www.jboss.org/snowdrop) to 
support Springframework in JBossAS. For detail information, please see:
