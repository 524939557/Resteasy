    <title>JBoss 5.x Integration</title>
    <para>Resteasy 1.2.1.GA has no special integration with JBoss Application Server so it must be configured and installed
    like any other container.  There are some issues though.  You must make sure that there is not a copy
    of servlet-api-xxx.jar in your WEB-INF/lib directory as this may cause problems.  Also, if you are running
    with JDK 6, make sure to filter out the JAXB jars as they come with JDK 6.</para>
