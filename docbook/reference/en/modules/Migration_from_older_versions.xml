                The constructors for ClientRequest that have a HttpClient parameter (Apache Http Client 3.1 API)  are now deprecated.  They will be removed in the final release of 1.2.  You must create a Apache hTTP Client Executor and pass it in as a parameter if you want to re-use existing Apache HttpClient sessions or do any special configuration.  The same is true for the ProxyFactoyr methods.

                Apache HttpClient 4.0 is now the default client used for our ClientRequest and ProxyFactory APIs.  Version 3.1 of this library is still support.  Just allocate an executor for that instead.  Or you can set the default one used by modifying the static field ClientRequest.defaultExecutorClass.

             It is no longer required to call RegisterBuiltin.register() to initialize the set of providers.  Too many users forgot to do this (include myself!).  You can turn this off by calling the static method ResteasyProviderFactory.setRegisterBuiltinByDefault(false)
